* Introduction
Refer to the original [[https://github.com/dempfi/ayu][Ayu-theme]]. It's truly an amazing set of theme and someone has to port it to Emacs eventually.

This repo currently provides 3 versions of Ayu-theme: the light, they grey & the dark. Refer to the files with correspondent
names.

* Installing

Just copy the lisp files to your emacs config dir (ie: *~/.emacs.d*) and load them...

*Example*
#+begin_src  code
cp ayu-*.el ~/.emacs.d/themes
#+end_src

And somewhere, with a little lisp...
#+begin_src lisp
(setq custom-theme-directory "~/.emacs.d/themes")
#+end_src

* Why not Melpa?
I'd love to have this published to *Melpa* but I'm just too lazy to do that. If you find it nice and worth sharing, and if you can help publishing this, that would be awesome.

It's possible to install them using [[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa][Quelpa]], though.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package ayu-theme
  :quelpa
  (ayu-theme :repo "vutran1710/Ayu-Theme-Emacs" :fetcher github)
  :config
  (load-theme 'ayu-dark t))
#+END_SRC

All go to the original author of Ayu-theme.

I just did the copy works.

The colors might not be 100% accurate.
